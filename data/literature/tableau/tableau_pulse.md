# What is Tableau Pulse?

## Get AI-powered insights when and where you need them.
Tableau Pulse is a reimagined data experience, built on the Tableau platform, that empowers every employee with intelligent, personalized, and contextual insights delivered in the flow of work. Tableau Pulse helps everyone in your organization integrate data into their daily jobs to make better, faster decisions. Without having to learn a new tool or build comprehensive visualizations, Tableau Pulse helps you go beyond the how and what and shows you the why behind your data.

## Insights Platform
Knowing where, when, and why to pay attention to your business has never been easier. Within Tableau Pulse, the Insights platform automatically detects drivers, trends, contributors, and outliers for the metrics you follow. It proactively flags changes that matter to you. Using natural language and supporting visual explanations, Tableau Pulse summarizes the insights so you can make appropriate and timely decisions.

## Metrics Layer
Create a standard definition of your data to power your insights and analysis in Tableau Cloud. Tableau Pulseâ€™s metrics layer lets you define metrics and enrich them with real-world business context. You can reuse your metrics to solve countless use cases and maintain consistency across your organization.

Say that you're a member of a sales organization, and that organization needs to track metrics
across different territories and product lines. In Tableau Pulse, you would create a metric
definition that includes the core value of the sum of daily sales with adjustable metric
filters for region and product line. Then, you would create metrics for each region and product line.
Finally, you would add members of your organization as followers to the metrics that cover where
and what they sell.

Tableau Pulse is powered by Tableau AI, a suite of predictive and generative AI capabilities that simplify and democratize data analysis and insight consumption at scale.
